# barber-appointment-frontend

<p>Have you ever tried to make an appointment at your barberâ€™s shop? How easy it is to make one? Its not!!! The barbers within the Arab region in Israel still make appointments on pieces of paper. You need to call them, they check the paper in front of them, and tell you what times are available.
This is a waste of time, for the barber, the customer who is getting a haircut at the same moment,  and the customer who is calling.
This website helps customers and businesses to make the scheduling process smoother and save some time.
